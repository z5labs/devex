# Plugins

This directory holds the [Claude Code plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins)
published by the [`z5labs-devex` marketplace](../.claude-plugin/marketplace.json).
Keeping them here keeps the plugin catalog cleanly separate from the Dagger
tooling (`daggerverse/`, `ci/`) and the docs (`docs/`).

> No plugins live here yet. The first one — the `new-dagger-module` skill,
> migrated in as `plan-dagger-module` — lands in
> [#124](https://github.com/z5labs/devex/issues/124).

## Convention

Each plugin is a self-contained directory:

```
plugins/
└── <name>/
    ├── .claude-plugin/
    │   └── plugin.json      # required manifest (only `name` is required)
    ├── skills/              # SKILL.md directories (auto-discovered)
    ├── commands/            # flat .md command files (auto-discovered)
    ├── agents/              # agent .md files (auto-discovered)
    └── hooks/               # hooks.json (auto-discovered)
```

- **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** describes the plugin. The only required field
  is `name` (kebab-case, used to namespace components, e.g.
  `<name>:<skill>`). `description`, `version`, and `author` are recommended.
- **Component directories** (`skills/`, `commands/`, `agents/`, `hooks/`) are
  discovered automatically when the plugin is installed — you only add a key to
  `plugin.json` to point at a non-default location.

See the [plugins reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference)
for the full `plugin.json` schema.

## Registering a plugin in the marketplace

After adding `plugins/<name>/`, append an entry to the `plugins` array in
[`../.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](../.claude-plugin/marketplace.json):

```json
{
  "name": "<name>",
  "source": "./plugins/<name>",
  "description": "What the plugin does"
}
```

The relative `source` path is resolved from the marketplace root (the directory
containing `.claude-plugin/`), so `./plugins/<name>` points at this directory.
Relative paths only resolve when the marketplace is added via git. If the
catalog grows, set `metadata.pluginRoot` to `"./plugins"` in `marketplace.json`
so entries can use the bare `"source": "<name>"` shorthand.
